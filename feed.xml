        <description>&lt;p&gt;Eurucamp 2014 was the conference, where I spoke for the first time. It gave me a great opportunity to speak in front of a crowd of like minded geeks. The Ruby community out there at Berlin is awesome. They sponsored the whole trip as I was a student. I was the only one from India as a speaker over there. I was the youngest speaker as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk was on “Web Controlled Automation”, where I talked about Internet of Things using Ruby and how I ended up buiding a robot car that can be controlled from a web app from anywhere around the world using any network for the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications of this technology include “Home and Industrial Automation”, “Security Systems”, “Automation at Hospitals and Traffic” etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video of my talk is here.&lt;/p&gt;
