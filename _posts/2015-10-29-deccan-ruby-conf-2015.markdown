title: "Deccan Ruby Conf 2015"

I spoke at [Deccan Ruby Conference](https://deccanrubyconf.org/) in August 2015. The organizers were awesome. The event was an one day event with lots of fun and code. 

The topic of my talk was "RFID Technology with the applications in the Internet of Things". In this talk, I described about the basics of RFID Technology with the reader and tag details and how to build a system that can recognize objects with their unique IDs. 

Along with that I talked about IoT using ruby with RFID. After that I talked about secured systems using FreeBSD jails. 

The video for the talk is here.
