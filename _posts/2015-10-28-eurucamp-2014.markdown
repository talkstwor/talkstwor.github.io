Eurucamp 2014 was the conference, where I spoke for the first time. It gave me a great opportunity to speak in front of a crowd of like minded geeks. The Ruby community out there at Berlin is awesome. They sponsored the whole trip as I was a student. I was the only one from India as a speaker over there. I was the youngest speaker as well. 

The talk was on "Web Controlled Automation", where I talked about Internet of Things using Ruby and how I ended up buiding a robot car that can be controlled from a web app from anywhere around the world using any network for the internet.

Applications of this technology include "Home and Industrial Automation", "Security Systems", "Automation at Hospitals and Traffic" etc. 

The video of my talk is here.
